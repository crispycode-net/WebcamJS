## Browser based Data Matrix scanning

Playground for testing various methods of image (pre-) processing with OpenCV.js (https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/df/df7/tutorial_js_table_of_contents_setup.html) and datamatrix code scanning with ZXing Browser (https://github.com/zxing-js/browser)

The goal is to find a solution that works fast and reliable enough even with small codes and low contrast. The image source currently is the (rear) webcam (designed to be used on smartphones).
